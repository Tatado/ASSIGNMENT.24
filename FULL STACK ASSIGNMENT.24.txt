              Def defined functions	                                                               lambda functions
Easy to interpret	                                                                Interpretation might be tricky
Can consists of any number of execution statements inside the function definition	The limited operation can be performed using lambda functions
2.
The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions3.
3.
Map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array individually.
 filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong. reduce ,
 on the other hand, takes all of the elements in an array and reduces them into a single value. Just like map and filter , 
reduce is defined on Array.
4.
Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions.
 These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python's runtime environment. 
Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations.
5.
Recursion is a programming technique using function or algorithm that calls itself one or more times until a specified condition is met at 
which time the rest of each repetition is processed from the last one called to the first.
6.
Safe: It can be used without causing harm.
Secure: It can't be hacked.
Reliable: It functions as it should, every time.
Testable: It can be tested at the code level.
Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
Portable: It works the same in every environment.
7.
The name, the number and type of the arguments, the return type, and the body. 
8.
A user-defined function is divided into three types such as function declaration, function definition, and function call.
